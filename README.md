# Spring Security Web Application 🔒🌐

This is a simple web application built with Spring MVC and secured using Spring Security. It demonstrates how to protect web resources and implement user authentication in a Spring Boot application.

## Features ✨

- 🔐 User authentication: The application requires users to log in before accessing protected pages.
- 🌈 Customizable login page: The login page is fully customizable and can be styled to match your application's theme.
- 🔗 Secure links: Links to protected pages are secured and require authentication.
- 🙋‍♂️ User-specific content: The application displays the username of the authenticated user on the secured pages.
- 🚪 Logout functionality: Users can securely log out of the application, ending their session.
- 🚫 Authorization: Different levels of access can be granted to users based on their roles and permissions.

## Getting Started 🚀

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-security-web-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd spring-security-web-app`
3. Build the application using Gradle: `./gradlew build` or Maven: `./mvnw clean package`
4. Run the application: `java -jar build/libs/spring-security-web-app.jar` (Gradle) or `java -jar target/spring-security-web-app.jar` (Maven)
5. Open your web browser and visit: `http://localhost:8080`

## Configuration 🛠️

The application's security configuration is defined in the `WebSecurityConfig` class. It sets up the following:

- URL paths that require authentication and those that are publicly accessible
- Custom login page location
- User details service for authentication

You can modify the configuration to suit your specific security requirements.

## User Credentials 🔑

The application comes with a pre-configured user for testing purposes:

- Username: user
- Password: password

You can add more users or integrate with a different user management system by modifying the `UserDetailsService` bean in the `WebSecurityConfig` class.
